        <h2>Description:</h2>
        The tastiest chicken burgers you will ever have! These pineapple-teriyaki chicken burgers are so flavorful, so juicy, we literally couldn't get enough of them. I am absolutely crazy about burgers, they are probably one of my favorite foods (aside from pizza), and it's been really fun playing around with different flavors and textures.
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>1 pound groud chicken</ul>

            <ul>1 cup minced bell pepper</ul>

            <ul>½ cup drained crushed pineapple</ul>

            <ul>2 cloves garlic, crushed</ul>

            <ul>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, or more to taste</ul>

            <ul>2 stalks green onion, sliced</ul>

            <ul>1 teaspoon pink salt</ul>

            <ul>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</ul>

            <ul>1 tablespoon avocado oil, or as needed</ul>

            <ul>6 medium brioche or hamburger buns</ul>

            <ul>6 leaves lettuce</ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Mix ground chicken, bell pepper, pineapple, garlic, 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, green onion, salt, and ginger together in a bowl. Make 6 equally portioned balls out of the mixture.</li>

                <li>Heat a large cast iron or ceramic nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil to the hot skillet and heat for 3 minutes. Place 2 to 3 balls into the skillet and flatten out with a spatula; cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165</li>

                <li>Place burgers on buns with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, ketchup, and more teriyaki sauce if desired.</li>
